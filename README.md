# Game War Simulator

## Disclaimer

This project is a programming and simulation exercise. It uses simplified and arbitrary rules to assign attributes such as health, intelligence, and physical fitness to simulated characters based on their names and a fictional "race" system. 

**Important:**
- The assignment of attributes by race or name in this project is entirely for game mechanics and does **not** reflect scientific, social, or ethical realities.
- There is no scientific basis for linking ability, intelligence, or physical traits to race or name. These mechanics are not intended to represent real-world genetics, anthropology, or sociology.
- The use of race and name-based attribute assignment is a common trope in games and simulations, but it is not supported by scientific evidence and should not be interpreted as such.
